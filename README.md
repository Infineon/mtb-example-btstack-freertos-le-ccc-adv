## Requirements

- [ModusToolbox&trade;](https://www.infineon.com/modustoolbox) v3.1 or later (tested with v3.1)
- Board support package (BSP) minimum required version for CYW989829M2EVB-01: v1.0.1
- Programming language: C


## Supported toolchains (make variable 'TOOLCHAIN')

- GNU Arm&reg; Embedded Compiler v10.3.1 (`GCC_ARM`) – Default value of `TOOLCHAIN`
- Arm&reg; Compiler v6.16 (`ARM`)
- IAR C/C++ Compiler v9.30.1 (`IAR`)


## Supported kits (make variable 'TARGET')

- [AIROC&trade; CYW89829 Bluetooth&reg; LE Evaluation Kit] (`CYW989829M2EVB-01`) – Default value of `TARGET`


## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

> **Note:** The AIROC&trade; CYW89829 Bluetooth&reg; Kit (CYW989829M2EVB-01) ships with KitProg3 v2.21 installed. The ModusToolbox&trade; requires KitProg3 v2.40. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/Infineon/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error such as "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".


## Software setup

See the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package installation guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxInstallguide) for information about installing and configuring the tools package.

Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://teratermproject.github.io/index-en.html).


## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; </b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox&trade; Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. On the **Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** page, select a kit supported by this code example. See the [Supported kits](#supported-kits-make-variable-target) section.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click on the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

    > **Note:** To use this code example for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog:

   a. Choose the code example from the list by enabling the checkbox.

   > **Note:** You can narrow the list of displayed examples by typing in the filter box.

   b. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

   c. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

   d. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface CLI</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; tools package provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and a command line tool, 'project-creator-cli'. The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the 'project-creator-cli' tool. On Windows, use the command-line 'modus-shell' program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; tools. You can access it by typing 'modus-shell' in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The 'project-creator-cli' tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br>

The following example clones the "[LE CCC Adv](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-btstack-freertos-ccc-scan)" application with the desired name "LeCccAdv" configured for the *CYW989829M2EVB-01* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CYW989829M2EVB-01 --app-id mtb-example-btstack-freertos-ccc-adv --user-app-name "LeCccsAdv" --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

> **Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the 'Project creator tools' section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can invoke the Library Manager GUI tool from the terminal using `make library-manager` command or use the Library Manager CLI tool 'library-manager-cli' to change the BSP.

The 'library-manager-cli' tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--add-bsp-name` | Name of the BSP that should be added to the application | Required
`--set-active-bsp` | Name of the BSP that should be as active BSP for the application | Required
`--add-bsp-version`| Specify the version of the BSP that should be added to the application if you do not wish to use the latest from manifest | Optional
`--add-bsp-location`| Specify the location of the BSP (local/shared) if you prefer to add the BSP in a shared path | Optional

<br>

The following example adds the CYW89829 BSP to the already created application and makes it the active BSP for the app.

```
library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/LeCccAdv" --add-bsp-name CYW989829M2EVB-01 --add-bsp-version "latest-v4.X" --add-bsp-location "local"

library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/LeCccAdv" --set-active-bsp APP_CYW989829M2EVB-01
```

## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Use a serial terminal application tool of your choice and connect it to the KitProg3 COM port. Configure the terminal application to access the serial port using the following settings:

   Baud rate: 115200 bps; Data: 8 bits; Parity: None; stop: 1 bit; Flow control: None; New line for receiving data: Line Feed (LF) or auto setting.

3. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>In other IDEs</b></summary>

   Follow the instructions in your preferred IDE.
   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

   From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain and target are specified in the application's Makefile but you can override those values manually:
   ```
   make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
   ```

   For Example:
   ```
   make program TARGET=CYW989829M2EVB-01 TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
   ```
   </details>

4. After programming, the application starts automatically with the CCC Scan and CCC Adv applications. Observe the messages on the UART terminal; CCC Adv will start advertisement, and CCC Scan will start scanning. If the CCC Scan application finds the advertisement data, it will print the CCC_DK_UUID and CCCSERVICEDATAINTENT_UUID. To see the Bluetooth&reg; stack and application trace messages in the terminal window, use the KitProg3 COM port.

   **Figure 1. Log messages on KitProg3 COM port**

   ![](images/uart_log_snap.png)
   
5. Configure the CCC Scan and Adv parameters as shown below:

   **CCC Scan Parameters:**

   Parameter | Description
   ----------|------------
   `high_duty_scan_interval` | High duty scan interval (in slots (1 slot = 0.625 ms))
   `high_duty_scan_window` | High duty scan window (in slots (1 slot = 0.625 ms))
   `high_duty_scan_duration` | High duty scan duration in seconds ('0' for infinite)

   <br>

   **CCC Adv parameters:**

   Parameter | Description
   ----------|------------
   `high_duty_min_interval` | High duty undirected connectable minimum advertising interval (in slots (1 slot = 0.625 ms))
   `high_duty_max_interval` | High duty undirected connectable maximum advertising interval (in slots (1 slot = 0.625 ms))
   `high_duty_duration` | High duty undirected connectable advertising duration in seconds ('0' for infinite)

   <br>

   > **Note:** For more details on the CCC Adv data fields, See [Car Connectivity Consortium](https://carconnectivity.org/digital-key/).
 
6. Scan will stop after finding CCC advertisements or exceeding the `CY_BT_HIGH_DUTY_SCAN_DURATION` time. Advertisement will stop after `CY_BT_HIGH_DUTY_ADV_DURATION`. Press the user button on the board to restart scan and advertisement.



## Steps to enable BTSpy logs

1. Navigate to the application Makefile and open it. Find the `ENABLE_SPY_TRACES` Makefile variable and set it to the value '1' as follows:

    ```
    ENABLE_SPY_TRACES = 1
    ```
2. Save the Makefile, and then build and program the application to the board.

3. Open the [ClientControl](https://github.com/Infineon/btsdk-host-apps-bt-ble/tree/master/client_control) application and make the following settings:
   - Set the baud rate to 3000000.
   - Deselect flow control.
   - Select the serial port and click on an open port.

4. Launch the [BTSpy](https://github.com/Infineon/btsdk-utils/tree/master/BTSpy) tool.

5. Press and release the reset button on the board to get the BTSpy logs on the BTSpy tool.

## Design and implementation

This code example configures CCC scan and CCC Adv as Bluetooth&reg; GAP central and GAP peripheral. The peripheral sends an advertisement using CCC_DK_UUID and CCCSERVICEDATAINTENT_UUID. These two UUIDs are centrally scanned and filtered to ensure the advertisement sender's identity. The user button is used to restart the scanning/advertising once the scanning/advertising duration has passed. To print debug messages on the UART terminal emulator, the application makes use of a UART resource from the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL). The retarget-io library is used to initialize the UART resources and retarget standard I/O to the UART port.

## Resources and settings

This section explains ModusToolbox&trade; resources and their configurations as used in this code example.

> **Note:** All the configurations explained in this section have already been implemented in the code example.

- **Device Configurator:** ModusToolbox&trade; stores the configuration settings of the application in the *design.modus* file. This file is used by the Device Configurator, which generates the configuration firmware. This firmware is stored in the application’s *GeneratedSource* folder.

   By default, all applications in a workspace share the same *design.modus* file - that is, they share the same pin configuration. Each BSP has a default *design.modus* file in the *mtb_shared\TARGET_\<bsp name\>\<version\>\COMPONENT_BSP_DESIGN_MODUS* directory. It is not recommended to modify the configuration of a standard BSP directly.

   To modify the configuration for a single application or to create a custom BSP, see the [ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide). This example uses the default configuration. See the [Device Configurator guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxDeviceConfig).

- **Bluetooth&reg; Configurator:** The Bluetooth&reg; peripheral has an additional configurator called the 'Bluetooth&reg; Configurator' that is used to generate the Bluetooth&reg; LE GATT database and various Bluetooth&reg; settings for the application. These settings are stored in the file named *design.cybt*.

> **Note:** Unlike the Device Configurator, the Bluetooth&reg; Configurator settings and files are local to each respective application. The services and characteristics added are explained in the [Design and implementation](#design-and-implementation) section. See the [Bluetooth&reg; Configurator guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxBLEConfig) for further information.

> **Note:** For CYW20829/CYW89829, if you want to use the Bluetooth&reg; Configurator tool, select the **AIROC&trade; BTSTACK with Bluetooth&reg; LE** only (CYW20829/CYW89829, PSoC&trade; 6 with CYW43xxx connectivity device) option from the drop-down menu to select the device. Do not use the PSoC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; LE Legacy Stack (PSoC&trade; 6-BLE) option because it is not compatible with AIROC&trade; BTSTACK.

**Table 1. Application resources**

Resource  |  Alias/object     |    Purpose
:------- | :------------    | :------------
UART (HAL) |cy_retarget_io_uart_obj | UART HAL object used by Retarget-IO for the debug UART port
GPIO (HAL)    | CYBSP_USER_LED2         | This LED serves as an indication for advertisement and scan start blinking 10 second
GPIO (HAL)    | CYBSP_USER_BTN         | Used to start scan or advertisement
